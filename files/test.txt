“So few grains of happinessmeasured against all the darkand still the scales balance.The world asks of usonly the strength we have and we give it.Then it asks more,and we give it.”

I let these verses written by Jane Hirschfeld sink in on a rainy evening whenthe power was out and the thunder rumbled so loud and close that it drowned theunsettling Prateek Kuhad song playing at our neighbour’s house. Rain assumes adifferent meaning according to your mood and, on this evening, it fell in analien language, like a forced confrontation, like tears shed over all the lovein the world that wasn’t reciprocated.

I sat drenched in a familiar feeling of emptiness, which I have felt every timeI lose a loved one to reckless emotional outbursts. This time, it was this guyI knew from a book club who also grew up clinically depressed, who dealt withhis lonely childhood by aggressively devouring Camus and Sartre and Ambedkar –as if texts could compensate for the friends we could never make.

He grew up playing in the lush green countryside of Satara. I grew upscampering around the congested streets of Cuttack. I had never seen sugarcanefields, he had never lived through a cyclone.

While we were able to bridge the differences in our cultures, there was a moreurgent, contemporary problem we struggled to solve: long distance. There areonly so many fights you can resolve over a phone call, only so many warm wordsyou can say to make up for the body heat you aren’t sharing, only so manynights you can pretend that a pillow makes up for the lack of a person.

No one wants to love a difficult woman (and definitely not from afar), in aworld full of others who won’t take as much of your time in being understood,who do not need so much decoding. Sometimes communication must be physical innature to be complete instead of being limited to conversations – an apology inthe form of holding each other’s hands, bereavement by falling asleep in hislap, middle grounds achieved while doing the dishes together. I didn’t know fortwo years of the relationship that he talked in his sleep, he never discoveredI cut myself sometimes on my arms.

In the kitchen, my parents were making tea. My mother was laughing at myfather’s jokes, which he forgot he has already cracked more than once.

What made the relationships of my parent’s generation different from ours isclear: they were looking for companionship and togetherness. We are looking forconvenience masquerading as compatibility, a conditional love that wouldcollapse under the weight of circumstances since it was motivated purely byself-interests.

For them, it was enough that love had arrived. For us, the mere attendance oflove isn’t enough – love has to be in the same time zone, growing at the samepace as us, never taking more space than what we allot to it, never making uscompromise on our daily schedules. While they were moved by simplicity, we arealways second guessing.

The trust between them was taken for granted instead of being constantlypoliced; their intimacy borne out of persistence and patience instead ofchance. For us, forgiveness is never worth the effort if we can abandon therelationship, and merely leave rather than investing on reparation and selfinterrogation.

So much energy goes into matching our own expectations, there are so manynights we cry by breaking our own hearts, and by holding our lovers guilty fortheir normality and humanness.

This is the opposite of compromise, a weird state of being extremelysentimental about our own independence. A collective delusion that partners aremanifestations of our own self worth or social status. We keep score, treateverything with an opportunity cost, and show up on dates with performanceanxiety to live up to our social media profiles.

In one book club session, now completely virtual, we discussed Ezra Klein’s WhyWe Are Polarized. “We are so locked into our political identities that there isvirtually no candidate, no information, no condition, that can force us tochange our minds,” he wrote. “We will justify almost anything or anyone so longas it helps our side, and the result is a politics devoid of guardrails,standards, persuasion, or accountability.”

Just like we engaged in online political discussions as a means of selfvalidation and tribalism rather than genuine discourse which benefited bothparties, the fights in our relationships seemed to be a war of othering andproving wrong. Our cancel culture has been spilling into our relationships,confrontations have become a courtroom trial rather than an attempt atunderstanding each other.

Love has died a quiet death in a contest of self righteousness.

“No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up theattempt,” wrote Sally Rooney in Normal People. “Go running in the otherdirection, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, whynot.”

I didn’t know why not.

Back in school, they told us love was some kind of “distraction”, a misleadingtemptation which was supposed to test your self-restraint. Only losers fell inlove. “Winners” never gave in to their emotions, never made a fool ofthemselves by being hopeful. Love was feminine. Love was shameful. Love wasanti-spiritual, capitalistic, and against Indian culture. Apathy was rational,cynicism was a safe space, loneliness was our intended state of being.

Maybe Arundhati Roy was right, I thought, we indeed have held in our bellies somuch violence that it is hard to be moral anymore. It is hard to be altruisticwithout feeling coerced, or selfless without feeling violated. Breakups aremuch more frequent for us because denial is our defence mechanism. Angershielded ‘grief’, the modern metaphor for weakness.

“My view of human nature is that all of us are just holding it together invarious ways and that’s okay,” wrote philosopher Alain de Botton. “We just needto go easy with one another, knowing that we’re all these incredibly fragilebeings.”

I believed tenderness was a drawback until I read about people falling in loveduring the Holocaust, during world wars and colonialism and on death beds.Tenderness isn’t a disability, but a gift one must learn to use.

The sound of my mother laughing brought me back to the moment and I wondered ifmy father cracked the same joke for the third time. I could still hear PrateekKuhad faintly singing about his heart being a mess.

The rain fell kindly now, like the light and innocent footsteps of a child whohad just discovered the glory of walking. As Satara kept growing its crops andCuttack kept wrestling with its ferociously flooding river streams, I decidedto write about two lovers and an alternate, happy ending. Since life didn’twait for us to find closure together, we must find it separately, even if it’spossible only under the facade of fiction. At least in the story and in ourannihilating fear of being vulnerable ever again, we will find a commonality.
